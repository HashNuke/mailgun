Mailgun
=========
This gem allows for idiomatic Mailgun usage from within ruby. Mailgun is a kickass email-as-a-service that lets you use email as if it made sense. Check it out at http://mailgun.net/

The official gem repo is at https://github.com/Bushido/mailgun

Mailgun exposes the following resources:

  * Routes
  * Log
  * Stats
  * Messages
  * Mailboxes

Currently the gem only exposes the Mailbox API, but patches are welcome (and easy!). 

Usage
=====
We mimic the ActiveRecord-style interface.

    # Initialize your Mailgun object:
    @mailgun = Mailgun(:api_key => 'your-api-key')
    
    # Create a mailbox
    @mailgun.mailbox.create "new-mailbox@your-domain.com", "password"
    
    # List all mailboxes that belong to a domain
    @mailgun.mailboxes.list "domain.com"
    
    # Destroy a mailbox (queue bond-villian laughter)
    # "I'm sorry Bond, it seems your mailbox will be... destroyed!"
    @mailbox.mailboxes.destroy "bond@mi5.co.uk"

Making Your Changes
===================
